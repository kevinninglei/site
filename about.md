Hi, my name is Kevin. I'm currently an engineer @ Spotify. I enjoy simple mental models (until more complexity is needed) and first principle thinking. This blog is currently used to battle test my own assumptions and thoughts. I don't currently have a good way to solicit feedback, in case any assumptions I made are incorrect or if there are any general questions. I promise to have that soon. Oh yeah, thoughts are my own.
